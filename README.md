Plotly's Python-API
===================

#### Functionality I Have Added

heartbeat() - call this function when you want to keep the connection alive, but do not want to send data within the 60s window.

#### Shareable, interactive, publication-quality plots in your web browser.

###Nutshell

Now you can download, design, and upload Plotly figures--all from Python.

###Where to go from here

* [Get started with our guide book!](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/plotly/python-user-guide/blob/master/s0_getting-started/s0_getting-started.ipynb)

* Official docs: [https://plot.ly/python](https://plot.ly/python)

###Contributing?

This project uses git submodules! After forking and cloning, in your terminal 
run `make` from inside your local `python-api/` repository. That will spit out 
the `make_instructions.txt` file. Checkout the *Getting started* section in 
there for more info.
